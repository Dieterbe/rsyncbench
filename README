read the comments in the config

== running the benchmark ==
rsyncbench

note: rsyncbench does not violate SI prefixes.
 * M  means 10^6
 * Mi means 2^20

Note that ls and dd are in powers of 2 by default even when
they imply they aren't (i.e. they violate SI prefixes)

== hacking ==
plugins won't be executed, only sourced.  they have access to everything in your config
plugins should end on .sh
each test 'plugin' should have a corresponding graph.gp file
you should override test_run and test_graph, and you can override test_init (if the pool dir
must be popupated with specific data you need)
$src and $dst are not necessarily clean when you're invoked, the idea being
you might use what's already there. but probably you'll have to delete the data first
